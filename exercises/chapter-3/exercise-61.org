#+title: Exercise 61
* Prompt
Let $S$ be a power series whose constant term is 1. Suppose we want to find the power series $1/S$, that is, the series $X$ such that $SX=1$. Write $S=1+S_R$ where $S_R$ is the part of $S$ after the constant term. Then we can solve for $X$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
  S \cdot X &= 1,&&\\
  \left( 1 + S_R \right) \cdot X &= 1,\\
  X + S_R \cdot X &= 1,\\
  X &= 1 - S_R \cdot X
\end{align}
$$
