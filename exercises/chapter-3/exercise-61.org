#+title: Exercise 61
* Prompt
Let $S$ be a power series whose constant term is 1. Suppose we want to find the power series $1/S$, that is, the series $X$ such that $SX=1$. Write $S=1+S_R$ where $S_R$ is the part of $S$ after the constant term. Then we can solve for $X$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
  S \cdot X &= 1,\\
  \left( 1 + S_R \right) \cdot X &= 1,\\
  X + S_R \cdot X &= 1,\\
  X &= 1 - S_R \cdot X
\end{align}
$$

In other words, $X$ is the power series whose constant term is 1 an whose higher-order terms are given by the negative of $S_{R}$ times $X$. fuse this idea to write a procedure ~invert-unit-series~ that computes $1/S$ for a power series $S$ with constant term 1. You will need to use ~mul-series~ from the previous exercise.
