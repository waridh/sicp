#+title: Exercise 59
* Prompt
In the previous section, we saw how to implement a polynomial arithmetic system representing polynomials as lists of terms. In a similar way, we can work with /power series/, such as

$$
\begin{align}
  e^{x} &= 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3 \cdot 2} + \frac{x^4}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} + \dots,\\
  \cos x &= 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} - \dots,\\
  \sin x &= x - \frac{x^3}{3 \cdot 2} + \frac{x^5}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} - \dots
\end{align}
$$

represented as infinite streams. We will represent the series $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots$ as the stream whose elements are the coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots$
