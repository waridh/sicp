#+title: Exercise 36
* Prompt

Suppose we evaluate the following sequence of expressions in the global environment:

#+begin_src racket :exports code
(define a (make-connector))
(define b (make-connector))
(set-value! a 10 'user)
#+end_src


At some time, during evaluation of the ~set-value!~, the following expression fro the connector's local procedure is evaluated:

#+begin_src racket :exports code
(for-each-except
 setter inform-about-value constraints)
#+end_src

Draw an environment diagram showing the environment in which the above expression is evaluated.
* Solution

Right, so basically, we are trying to resolve what is happening in line 3.

The following image shows the environment diagram for the evaluation of the specified line.
