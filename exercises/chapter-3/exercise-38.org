#+title: Exercise 38
* Prompt
Suppose that Peter, Paul, and Mary share a joint bank account that initially contains $100. Concurrently, Peter deposits $10, Paul withdraws $20, and Mary withdraws half the money in the  account, by executing the following commands:

#+begin_src racket :exports code
(set! balance (+ balance 10))
(set! balance (- balance 20))
(set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2)))
#+end_src

a. List all the different possible values for ~balance~ after these three transactions have been completed, assuming that the banking system forces the three processes to run sequentially in some order.
b. What are some other values that could be produced if the system allows the processes to be interleaved? Draw timing diagrams like the one in the chapter to explain how these values can occur.
* Solution
** Part A
In the sequential case, the different values are entirely dependent on when the half the money withdraw happens. Since it is dependent on this, we are going to see 4 solutions.

- (+ 10) -> (/ 2) -> (- 20) = 35
- (- 20) -> (/ 2) -> (+ 10) = 50
- (/ 2) -> (+ 10) -> (- 20) = 40
- (+ 10) -> (- 20) -> (/ 2) = 45

** Part B

The problem that is occurring here is that the different processes could have done the read operation on the balance at the same time. In this situation, we basically see that some of the transactions will just not be registered.

#+begin_src plantuml :exports results :results file :file ./images/3.38-first.png
@startuml
peter <- bank : read 100
paul <- bank : read 100
mary <- bank : read 100
mary -> bank : write 100 / 2 = 50
paul -> bank : write 100 - 20 = 80
peter -> bank : write 100 + 10 = 110
@enduml
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./images/3.38-first.png]]

In this first case, all the transactions are re-written by Peter's transaction. This would be disasterous for the bank.

#+begin_src plantuml :exports results :results file :file ./images/3.38-second.png
@startuml
peter <- bank : read 100
paul <- bank : read 100
mary <- bank : read 100
mary -> bank : write 100 / 2 = 50
peter -> bank : write 100 + 10 = 110
paul -> bank : write 100 - 20 = 80
@enduml
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./images/3.38-second.png]]

In this case, we are seeing that Paul's write overwrote the other cases.

#+begin_src plantuml :exports results :results file :file ./images/3.38-third.png
@startuml
peter <- bank : read 100
paul <- bank : read 100
mary <- bank : read 100
peter -> bank : write 100 + 10 = 110
paul -> bank : write 100 - 20 = 80
mary -> bank : write 100 / 2 = 50
@enduml
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./images/3.38-third.png]]

Finally, in this permutation of the read first, we see that Mary's case overwrote the other cases.

Now we are done the cases in which the reads are done at the same time, now we are to describe the cases where just two of the processes read the value at the same time. Suddenly, the combinations have become much more complex, We now need to keep track of which of the two processes that read at the same time shall write last, which affects the value that the last process will read. There are three combinations of values that could be read at the same time, and each of those have two possible values that could be the final overwrite, giving us an expected 6 possible sequence where two of the processes read at the same time first, and the third process reading the value last.

Now we have the final combination to look through. Here, one of the processes will complete before the others, and the other two will read the completed values, and one of the two will complete correctly. This will also result in another 6 sequence of operations.

This concludes all the cases in which the processes have overlapping computation, causing an error in the result.

Actually, correction: there are additional special cases where the Mary case could be interrupted midway through, since there are actually two reads in this case, meaning that the other processes could interleave writes in this middle read, giving us another group of new values. This is a quirk of how the program was written to calculate the value written by Mary's process.

Here are the cases.
- The first Mary read is of the initial state, and then some write happens, and the second Mary read happens, which would mean that the Mary computation will now produce a different value than the atomic assumption done before.
  - Mary's second read could either be:
    - Paul only
    - Peter only
    - sequentially both Paul and Peter
  - Now Mary must write, which may or may not interleave with one more process.
    - Paul already wrote, so Peter reads from Mary
    - Peter already wrote, so Paul reads from Mary
    - Paul and Peter already interleaved, so Mary is the last operation
- Some process write a result first, and Mary will read that value as the first read, and the other process write as the second read
  - Here, the second process write could have either read from the initial state, or the newly written state
  - Paul wrote first
    - Peter read from initial
    - Peter read from Paul
  - Peter wrote first
    - Paul read from initial
    - Paul read from Peter

Now we will illustrate the different cases.
